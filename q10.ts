// 10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least
// one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your
// programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at
// the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the
// program does.

// let favouriteNumber:number = 17;
// let messagefor = "My favourite number is";
// console.log(`hello, ${messagefor}: ${favouriteNumber}`);

// this program tells the favourite number of mine
